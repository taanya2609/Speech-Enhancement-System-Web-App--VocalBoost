# Speech-Enhancement-System-Web-App--VocalBoost
VocalBoost is an AI-powered web application that enhances speech clarity by removing background noise. Using a Denoising Autoencoder trained on paired noisy and clean audio datasets, it processes recordings via Flask and FFmpeg. Users can upload or record audio, view spectrograms, and download the improved, noise-free version in real time.
